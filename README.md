GPA Calculator
 This program will compute the gpa out of three courses that the student has taken.

    For each course: the user will need input
        the course title
        the credit hours
        the grade (A, B, C, D, F)

    compute the gpa.
        For example, Programming, 4 credit hours, A
        Running, 2 credit hours, B
        Painting, 3 credit hours, C
        gpa = (4*4 + 2*3 + 3*2)/(4+2+3)

        A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0

        Note: No credit hour(s) will be given to a course with an "F" grade.
        However, "0" will be counted into the overall GPA computation.
        For example, assume you have done two courses with 3 credit hours each. If you got a B and an F, then you have only received 3 credits and your gpa is 1.5. 

    Repeat the above for the other two courses.

    the program will list the details and the total credit hours obtained, and the gpa.

    Requirements:
        correctness
        For instance, your program will compute gpa correctly.

        nice/clear/clean layouts - both input and output
        Picture yourself as the user. Make your program friendly and easy-to-use.

        good documentation
        In the future, other software engineers will be able to read your documentation and understand your code without much struggle.
        For example:
        ### course1_title is used for storing the title of the first course. ###

        Name your file as cs120_project1_yourlastname.py

        Email project 1 to [redacted] by Tue, 5:00 PM.
        Indicate this is for CS 120 project 1 in the email subject.
